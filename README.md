# Machine Learning and Statistics in R

**2018 CQS Summer Short Course: Machine Learning and Statistics in R**

This CQS Summer Institute course provides an introduction and overview of the most powerful and common machine learning methods and statistical inference techniques using R (The R Project for Statistical Computing: https://www.r-project.org). Upon completion of this course, participants will be able to select and apply off-the-shelf machine learning and statistical software tools to many different types of analytical tasks. **This course requires some familiarity with R/RStudio and basic math.**

## Software Installation

This course requires the use of RStudio. This software is open source and freely available for download and installation on all operating systems. See https://www.rstudio.org/

We will additionally make use of several freely available add-on packages for R, which are listed below and can be installed using the following R commands:

```rstats
install.packages("reshape2")
```
